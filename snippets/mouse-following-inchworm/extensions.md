1. **Start the inchworm where the mouse is** — Right now, the initial inchworm circles are all drawn at (100,100). Change the code so they are drawn at whatever point the mouse is at, *e.g.* (mouseX, mouseY). Can you take into account edge cases, like when the mouse is offscreen?
2. **Make the inchworm drift downward** — Once placed, the circles of our inchworm do not move until they are removed. Create an effect wherein, once a circle is drawn, it "falls" downward bit by bit until it is removed by the current algorithm.
3. **Pause the inchworm on click** — There is currently no way to stop the drawing of the inchworm when its page is open. Change the program so, when you click the mouse, the inchworm stops being drawn and all movement pauses. Now, can you make it restart when you click again, and then stop when you click yet again?
