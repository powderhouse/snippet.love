+ [Learn CSS Layout](http://learnlayout.com/) is a great walkthrough of the basics of positioning elements with CSS.  It has copious examples and explanations, and is worth walking through.
+ MDN's pages on [`position`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position), [`float`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float), and [`margin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin) are good references to see a bit more about how these behaviors are technically defined.
+ Shay Howe's [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) is a great resource which we recommend for all your HTML and CSS questions; his [section on positioning content]( http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/positioning-content/) is the pertinent section for this snippetâ€¦its materials on `float` are especially good.
